thought then since this earth afford no joy to me but to command to cheque to o erbear such as are of better person than myself i ll make my heaven to dream upon the crown and while i live to account this world but hell until my mis shaped trunk that bear this head be round impale with a glorious crown and yet i know not how to get the crown for many lives stand between me and home and i like one lost in a thorny wood that rend the thorn and is rent with the thorn seek a way and stray from the way not knowing how to find the open air but toil desperate to find it out torment myself to catch the english crown and from that torment i will free myself or hew my way out with a bloody axe why i can smile and murder while i smile and cry content to that which grieve my heart and wet my cheek with artificial tear and frame my face to all occasion i ll drown more sailor than the mermaid shall i ll slay more gaze than the basilisk i ll play the orator as well as nestor deceive more sly than ulysse could and like a sinon take another troy i can add colours to the chameleon change shape with proteu for advantage and set the murderous machiavel to school can i do this and cannot get a crown tut were it farther off i ll pluck it down exit 3 king henry vi

an idle and most false imposition oft got without merit and lost without deserving you have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself such a loser what man there are ways to recover the general again you are but now cast in his mood a punishment more in policy than in malice even so as one would beat his offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion sue to him again and he s yours

devil wrath one unperfect show me another to make me frankly despise myself iago come you are too severe a morale as the time the place and the condition of this country stand i could heartily wish this had not befallen but since it is as it is mend it for your own good cassio i will ask him for my place again he shall tell me i am a drunkard had i as many mouth as hydra such an answer would stop them all to be now a sensible man by and by a fool and presently a beast o strange every inordinate cup is unbless and the ingredient is a devil iago come come good wine is a good familiar creature if it be well use exclaim no more against it and good lieutenant i think you think i love you cassio i have well approve it sir i drunk iago you or any man living may be drunk at a time man i

advise me well iago i protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness cassio i think it freely and betimes in the morning i will beseech the virtuous desdemona to undertake for me i am desperate of my fortune if they cheque me here iago you are in the right good night lieutenant i must to the watch cassio good night honest iago exit iago and what s he then that say i play the villain when this advice is free i give and honest probe to thinking and indeed the course to win the moor again for tis most easy the incline desdemona to subdue in any honest suit she s frame as fruitful as the free elements and then for her to win the moor were t to renounce his baptism all seal and symbol of redeem sin his soul is so enfetter d to her love that she may make unmake do what she list even as her appetite shall play the god with his weak function how am i then a villain to counsel cassio to this parallel course directly to his good divinity of hell when devil will the blackest sin put on they do suggest at first with heavenly show as i do now for while this honest fool ply desdemona to repair his fortune and she for him plead strong to the moor i ll pour this pestilence into his ear that she repeal him for her body s lust and by how much she strive to do him good she shall undo her credit with the moor so will i turn her virtue into pitch and out of her own goodness make the net

grow beneath their shoulder this to hear would desdemona seriously incline but still the house affair would draw her thence which ever as she could with haste dispatch she ld come again and with a greedy ear devour up my discourse which i observing took once a pliant hour and found good means to draw from her a prayer of earnest heart that i would all my pilgrimage dilate whereof by parcel she had something heard but not intent i did consent and often did beguile her of her tear when i did speak of some distressful stroke that my youth suffer d my story being done she gave me for my pains a world of sigh she swore in faith twa strange twa passing strange  twa pitiful twa wondrous pitiful she wish d she had not heard it yet she wish d that heaven had made her such a man she thank d me and
